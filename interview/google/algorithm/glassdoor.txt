Find if the given string contains an anagram of another smaller string.  
Given a string, find the longest substring T that contains m distinct characters. (need O(n) solution)
Given two strings with the same characters except for one additional character in one string, return that additional character. 
First round:
# A represents the set { sum list of numbers } 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ------like this
A = [(2,3), (5,7), (9,10)]

# B represents the set {another list of numbers } 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
B = [(1,3), (5,10)]

These lists always have the following properties:
* Intervals are listed in ascending order.
* Intervals are merged whenever possible.
  i.e. you'll never see [(1,3), (4,5)] because it would be merged into [(1,5)]

1. When we see a new event ID, we need to add it to the set. Write a function to add a number to one of these sets, while maintaining the above properties.
